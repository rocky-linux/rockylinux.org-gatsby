## What Data Do We Collect and Receive?

In order for us to both provide and maintain our Services, we collect certain information, including through [Matomo](https://matomo.org) for analytics on our websites. Depending on your use of the Services, we may collect the following information:

- **Information you provide when you contact us** – for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem, we will collect any information you provide to us, at a minimum including your email address, and message. We use this data in connection with answering the queries we receive.

- **Usage data** – when you use or visit any of our sites or services (e.g. YUM/DNF), unless explicitly noted, we do collect your IP address, browser user agent, operating system, geolocation, and referring website (when applicable). We log this data in order to maintain metrics, troubleshoot and maintain our services.

- **Information you provide when you create an account** – when you sign up for and open an account on our account services page, chat service, or forum we may ask you to provide us with information such as your name, email address and other details. As otherwise detailed in this Privacy Policy, we will process this information to provide you with the service you signed up for.

- **Information you provide as a contributor and/or user** – We may collect information according to the type of contribution you provide. For example, if you are voluntarily testing our images or reporting bugs to us, in order to reproduce, troubleshoot, or validate those bugs, we may record things such as your operating system version, the system specifications of your computer (CPU, RAM, other hardware details), or packages and software versions installed on your computer.
