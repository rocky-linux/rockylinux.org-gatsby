The Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF) is pleased to announce the availability of the Rocky Linux 8.4 Release Candidate for:

| Architecture    | Boot | Minimal | Full/Everything |
| --------------- | ---- | ------- | --------------- |
| x86_64          | X    | X       | X               |
| ARM64 (aarch64) | X    | X       | X               |

Please note that a release candidate is not suitable for production use. You can report any bugs or issues [here](https://bugs.rockylinux.org). The upgrade from Rocky Linux 8.3 RC1 to Rocky Linux 8.4 RC1 is not supported, meaning it will not be tested nor documented.

To download the release, visit [https://rockylinux.org/download](https://rockylinux.org/download).

Release notes are available [here](https://docs.rockylinux.org/en/rocky/8/release_notes/rocky_linux_8-4_release).

Once this release candidate has been validated, we will transition Rocky Linux 8.4 to General Availability. If our 8.4 RC goes as smoothly as our 8.3 RC did, you won’t have long to wait.

## FAQ:

> What upgrade paths are supported?

Upgrading between release candidates, or from a release candidate to a stable release will not be supported. Release candidates are not suitable for production use, and are to be used for testing purposes only.

> Will there be a Rocky Linux 8.4 RC2 before Rocky Linux 8.4 GA?

No, we plan to iron out any reported bugs in Rocky Linux 8.4 RC1 and then move straight towards a GA release.

> Will there be a Rocky Linux 8.3 RC2, or a Rocky Linux 8.3 GA?

There will not be a stable release of Rocky Linux 8.3. The first stable release of Rocky Linux will be 8.4.
