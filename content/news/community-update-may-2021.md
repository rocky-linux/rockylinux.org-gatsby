## Summary

This has been a very exciting month for us. In the early hours of May 1, we published our release candidate for Rocky Linux 8.3. (If you haven’t yet, feel free to [download](https://rockylinux.org/download) that and get to testing it, and [let us know](https://bugs.rockylinux.org/) about any bugs you find.) We established a new [Testing team](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/testing), and they’ve been busy putting the RC through its paces. We’re pleased that we’ve encountered so few bugs, which is a testament to the hard work our release engineering team did in putting it together.

We also saw Red Hat release RHEL 8.4 on May 18, and are very excited about preparing our release candidate of 8.4. As soon as it’s ready and testing is completed, we anticipate being able to announce the general availability of Rocky Linux 8.4 for production use. Keep a close eye out for the announcement of the 8.4 release candidate, which should be coming soon.

Since we’re heads down squashing bugs, building packages, and debugging, you might notice that this update is lighter than others.

## Documentation

Some new developments and initiatives are brewing within the Rocky documentation group.

- We hosted this month’s team meeting/get-together on May 14, 2021.
- Individuals within the documentation group have been exploring and working with the Rocky web development team to test other platforms for serving and managing the docs.rockylinux.org platform. Thanks to @FromOZ and @antoine for spearheading this effort.
- We’ve had an uptick in the number of folks doing actual translations of existing Rocky Linux guides and as well as authoring brand new content in various languages.

## Release Engineering

Now that RHEL 8.4 has landed, we’re working to build a release candidate. Rocky Linux 8.4 will be our first GA release. As a reminder we will not officially support an upgrade path from 8.3 RC to 8.4 GA, or from 8.4 RC to 8.4 GA.

## Testing

If you’re interested in helping us test the Rocky Linux 8.4 RC, please join our Testing team! The Testing team meets weekly on Thursdays at 18:00 ET. There’s [live chat](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/testing) on our Mattermost server, and durable discussion on [our forums](https://forums.rockylinux.org/c/devel/testing).
