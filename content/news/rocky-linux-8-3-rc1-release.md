This release is the culmination of months of hard work from every corner of the community. What started in a comment thread on a Red Hat blog in December of 2020 grew to a community over ten thousand strong in a Slack channel in a matter of days. From there you pulled together to build teams around infrastructure, branding, website, development, special interest groups, and more. By February of 2021, over 80 million hits had been recorded across various social media platforms and news sites.

And now, four months later, we have a true open enterprise community operating system. More than that, we have a community, extending far beyond the scope of simply a Linux distribution.

We’d like to extend a special thanks to our sponsors and our partners, whose contribution of resources, financial backing, software, and infrastructure were all critical in supporting our efforts:

- CIQ
- 45Drives
- Amazon Web Services
- Fosshost
- Fastly
- GitLab
- Mattermost
- MontaVista
- NAVER Cloud
- OpenDrives

This is just the beginning. Our commitment to you is the long-lasting development and support of an open enterprise operating system by the community, and for the community.

We have so much more to do. From testing and validation of the core OS to the refinement of our build infrastructure and special interest groups, the work is not done. Come build the next open enterprise operating system with us at [https://rockylinux.org](https://rockylinux.org).
