Corporations come and go, their interests as transient as they are self-serving. But a community persists, and that’s who we dedicate Rocky Linux to: you.

Rocky is more than the next free and open, community enterprise operating system. It’s a community. A commitment to an ideal bigger than the sum of its parts, and a promise that our [principles](https://rockylinux.org/community-charter/)--embedded even within our repositories and ISOs--are immutable.

We’d like to extend a special thanks to our sponsors and our partners, whose contribution of resources, financial backing, software, and infrastructure were all critical in supporting our efforts:

- [45Drives](https://www.45drives.com/)
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [CIQ](https://ctrliq.com/)
- [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)
- [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [Google](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Mattermost](https://mattermost.org/)
- [MontaVista](https://www.mvista.com/)
- [NAVER Cloud](https://www.ncloud.com/)
- [OpenDrives](https://opendrives.com/)

Each one brings something special to the community, and we’re grateful for their support.

This is just the beginning, and the RESF is more than just Rocky Linux--it’s a home for those that believe that open source isn’t just a switch that can be toggled at will, and that projects that many rely on not be subject to the whims of a few. To this point, you can easily find all of our sources, our build infrastructure, Git repositories, and everything else anyone would need to fork our work and ensure that it continues if need be. Expect more from the RESF in the coming weeks and months.

When we announced our release candidate, we asked you to come build the next free, open, community enterprise operating system with us. Now we’re asking you for more: join us as we build our community.

> “We set out to develop a free, open, community enterprise operating system that is bug-for-bug compatible with the upstream Enterprise Linux standard. What we built is so much more: a community."
