    "introBodyText": "Each stable RPM package that is published by Rocky Linux is signed with a GPG signature. By default, yum and the graphical update tools will verify these signatures and refuse to install any packages that are not signed, or have an incorrect signature. You should always verify the signature of a package prior to installation. These signatures ensure that the packages you install are what was produced by Rocky Linux and have not been altered by any mirror or website providing the packages.",

    "importingBody1Text": "The Project GPG keys are included in the rockylinux-release package, and are typically found in /etc/pki/rpm-gpg. Please note that not all keys in this directory are used by the Rocky Linux project. Some keys may be placed in this directory by 3rd party repositories to enable the secure use of extra packages as well. The keys used by Rocky Linux are enabled in the yum repository configuration, so you generally don’t need to manually import them.",
    "importingBody2Text": "If you want to verify that the keys installed on your system match the keys listed here, you can use GnuPG to check that the key fingerprint matches. For example:",
