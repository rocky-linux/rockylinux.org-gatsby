          In tandem with Rocky Linux 9, we are releasing Peridot, the new build
          system with which it is forged. We are excited to open source Peridot,
          which has been in development for over a year! This release represents
          our commitment to free and open source software as well as the
          longevity of the project which necessitates that Rocky Linux is built
          in the open, with replicable and verifiable tooling.
